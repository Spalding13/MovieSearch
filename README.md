# MovieSearch
Search for movies on IMDB. The result is a grid page of panels with the movie title, year of production and a movie poster. 
Styled with Bootstrap for basic building blocks and mostly custom CSS.

This app uses the Open Movie Database API for data: http://www.omdbapi.com/ 

A mobile version will be released soon for Android devices!
